    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Originating in Argentina and Uruguay, chimichurri is an uncooked condiment that is typically served brushed, basted, or spooned onto food (most often meat like chicken and steak) as it cooks. It may also be served on the side or used as a marinade (highly recommended - best marinade ever).</p>

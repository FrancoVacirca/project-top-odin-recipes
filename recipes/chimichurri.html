    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Originating in Argentina and Uruguay, chimichurri is an uncooked condiment
      that is typically served brushed, basted, or spooned onto food (most often
      meat like chicken and steak) as it cooks. It may also be served on the
      side or used as a marinade (highly recommended - best marinade ever).
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup finely chopped parsley</li>
      <li>3-4 cloves garlic , finely chopped or minced</li>
      <li>
        2 small red chilies , or 1 red chili, deseeded and finely chopped (about
        1 tablespoon finely chopped chili)
      </li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 level teaspoon coarse salt</li>
      <li>pepper , to taste (about 1/2 teaspoon)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix all ingredients together in a bowl. Allow to sit for 5-10 minutes to
        release all of the flavours into the oil before using. Ideally, let it
        sit for more than 2 hours, if time allows.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chimichurri can be prepared earlier than needed, and refrigerated for 24
        hours, if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use to baste meats (chicken or steaks) while grilling or barbecuing. We
        don't use it as a marinade, but choose to baste our meats with
        chimichurri instead. However, you can use it as a marinade if you wish.
        Also, add a couple of tablespoons over your steak to serve.

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>On their own, with lemon, a la napolitana, stuffed, fried, baked, however you like them. Every family has their own favorite cut and coating but whatever the preference the milanesa is an ever-present on the Argentine table (even in vegetarian versions or with different meats). </p>
    <p>Argentinians have appropriated the concept of the milanesa. It's part of the country's gastronomic and cultural heritage, charged with symbolism as it represents the coming together of two of the country's historic treasures: beef and wheat.</p>
